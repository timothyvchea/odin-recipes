        <h2>What is Mapo Tofu?</h2>
            <p>Mapo Tofu is a spicy, savory dish from Sichuan, China. It is named <em>Mapo</em> tofu, as <em>Mapo</em> means pock-marked. It is said the the inventor of this dish was a pock-marked granny from Sichuan. It is a personal favorite of mine, and I consider it my staple dish.</p>
            <p>It is famed for it's use of Sichuan peppercorns. The peppercorns are not very spicy, however they leave a numbing sensation on the tongue.</p>
